## You will be able to create an SQL database including Schema and table structures

- **1. Understanding the Basics:**

  - **Database:**

    A container that holds tables, views, procedures, and other database objects.

  - **Schema:**

    A way to organize database objects and provide separation between them.

  - **Table:**

    A structured set of data elements organized in columns and rows.

- **2. Creating a Database:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE database_name;
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Creates a new database with the specified name.

- **3. Selecting a Database:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  USE database_name;
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Switches to the specified database for subsequent queries.

- **4. Creating a Table:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype1,
      column2 datatype2,
      ...
  );
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Defines a new table with columns and their data types.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
      employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(50),
      last_name VARCHAR(50),
      salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
  );
  ```

- **5. Understanding Data Types:**
  - **INT:**
    - Integer (whole number).
  - **VARCHAR(n):**
    - Variable-length character string with a maximum length of n.
  - **DECIMAL(p, s):**
    - Decimal number with precision p and scale s.
- **6. Adding Constraints:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name constraint_type (column1, column2, ...);
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Adds constraints to a table, such as a primary key.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE employees
  ADD CONSTRAINT pk_employee_id PRIMARY KEY (employee_id);
  ```

### **Metaphor:**

- **Creating an SQL Database is like Designing a Filing System:**

  Imagine your database is an organized filing cabinet. The database is the cabinet itself, schemas are drawers, and tables are folders inside drawers. Each column in a table is like a labeled compartment for specific types of information.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- Use **`CREATE DATABASE`** to create a new database.
- Use **`USE`** to switch to a specific database.
- Use **`CREATE TABLE`** to define the structure of a table.
- Specify data types for each column.
- Use constraints like **`PRIMARY KEY`** to enforce data integrity.

## You will understand DDL

- **1. DDL Overview:**

  **Data Definition Language (DDL):**

  SQL statements that define and manage the structure of a database.

- **2. Creating Tables:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype1,
      column2 datatype2,
      ...
  );
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Defines a new table with specified columns and data types.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE students (
      student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(50),
      last_name VARCHAR(50),
      age INT
  );
  ```

- **3. Modifying Tables:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD COLUMN column_name datatype;
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Adds a new column to an existing table.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE students
  ADD COLUMN grade CHAR(1);
  ```

- **4. Adding Constraints:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name constraint_type (column1, column2, ...);
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Adds constraints like primary keys or foreign keys to a table.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE students
  ADD CONSTRAINT pk_student_id PRIMARY KEY (student_id);
  ```

- **5. Dropping Objects:**

  ### **SQL Syntax:**

  ```sql
  DROP TABLE table_name;
  ```

  ### **Description:**

  - Deletes an existing table and all its data.

### **Metaphor:**

- **DDL is like Blueprinting a House:**
  - If creating a table is like designing a room with specific features, altering tables is like adding or removing rooms. Dropping a table is like demolishing a room. Constraints are like deciding the purpose of each room - a bedroom, a kitchen, etc.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **`CREATE TABLE`**: Defines a new table.
- **`ALTER TABLE`**: Modifies an existing table (adds columns, constraints, etc.).
- **`DROP TABLE`**: Deletes an existing table.

Understanding DDL is essential for shaping the structure of your database. It's like being the architect, builder, and interior designer all at once, creating a digital space that efficiently stores and organizes your data.

## You will understand different SQL datatypes, including automatically incrementing values

- **1. Common SQL Data Types:**
  - **INT:**
    - Integer data type for storing whole numbers.
  - **VARCHAR(n):**
    - Variable-length character string with a maximum length of n.
  - **DECIMAL(p, s):**
    - Decimal number with precision p and scale s.
  - **DATE:**
    - Stores date values.
  - **BOOLEAN:**
    - Represents true or false values.
- **2. Auto-Incrementing Values:**

  - **SERIAL or IDENTITY:**
    - Automatically generates unique, incremental values.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
      employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(50),
      last_name VARCHAR(50),
      salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
  );
  ```

- **3. Understanding SERIAL and IDENTITY:**

  - **SERIAL:**
    - Used in PostgreSQL.
  - **IDENTITY:**
    - Used in databases like SQL Server and PostgreSQL.

  ### **Example (IDENTITY):**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE students (
      student_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(50),
      last_name VARCHAR(50),
      age INT
  );
  ```

### **Metaphor:**

- **Data Types are like Containers:**
  - Think of each data type as a specific type of container that holds a certain kind of information. INT is like a box for whole numbers, VARCHAR is like a flexible bag for text, and DECIMAL is like a jar for precise numeric values.
- **Auto-Incrementing is like Giving Unique Serial Numbers:**
  - Imagine each row in your table is like an item in a store. Auto-incrementing is like assigning a unique serial number to each item, making it easy to identify and manage them.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **`INT`**: For whole numbers.
- **`VARCHAR(n)`**: Variable-length character string.
- **`DECIMAL(p, s)`**: Decimal numbers with precision and scale.
- **`DATE`**: For date values.
- **`BOOLEAN`**: For true or false values.
- Use **`SERIAL`** or **`IDENTITY`** for auto-incrementing values.

## You will understand constraints

- **1. Primary Key Constraint:**

  - **Purpose:**

    Ensures each record in a table is uniquely identified.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE students (
      student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(50),
      last_name VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Think of the primary key as the student ID card. Each student has a unique ID card, making it easy to identify and locate them.

- **2. Foreign Key Constraint:**

  - **Purpose:**

    Establishes a link between two tables based on a column in one table referring to the primary key in another.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE courses (
      course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      course_name VARCHAR(50)
  );

  CREATE TABLE student_courses (
      student_id INT,
      course_id INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
  );
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Imagine courses as books in a library. The foreign key is like a cross-reference pointing to the book's location in the library catalog.

- **3. Unique Constraint:**

  - **Purpose:**

    Ensures that all values in a column are unique.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
      employee_id INT UNIQUE,
      first_name VARCHAR(50),
      last_name VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Unique constraint is like ensuring there are no duplicate employee IDs, just like making sure each person has a unique employee number.

- **4. Check Constraint:**

  - **Purpose:**

    Defines a condition that each row must satisfy.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE purchases (
      purchase_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      product_name VARCHAR(50),
      quantity INT,
      price DECIMAL(10, 2),
      CHECK (quantity > 0 AND price > 0)
  );
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Check constraints are like quality control checks. For example, ensuring that the quantity of a purchased item is always greater than zero.

- **5. Not Null Constraint:**

  - **Purpose:**

    Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
  );
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Not null constraint is like making certain information mandatory. For instance, ensuring that customer names and emails are always provided.

### **Metaphor:**

- **Constraints are like Rules in a Game:**
  - Think of a database as a game with specific rules. Primary key ensures uniqueness, foreign key establishes relationships, unique constraint prevents duplicates, check constraint enforces specific conditions, and not null constraint makes certain fields mandatory.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Primary Key:**
  - Uniquely identifies each record.
- **Foreign Key:**
  - Establishes relationships between tables.
- **Unique Constraint:**
  - Ensures uniqueness of values in a column.
- **Check Constraint:**
  - Defines conditions for rows.
- **Not Null Constraint:**
  - Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.

## You will be able to perform robust queries on a database using WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, and IN clauses, etc

- **1. WHERE Clause:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Filters rows based on a specified condition.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 50000;
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Think of the WHERE clause as a filter applied to a list of employees, showing only those who work in the IT department and have a salary greater than $50,000.

- **2. LIKE Clause:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Searches for a specified pattern in a column.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM products
  WHERE product_name LIKE 'Laptop%';
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - LIKE is like a search bar for your database, finding products whose names start with "Laptop."

- **3. BETWEEN Clause:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Filters rows based on a range of values.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31';
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - BETWEEN is like specifying a date range to view only the orders made between the start and end of a year.

- **4. IN Clause:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Filters rows based on a list of values.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers
  WHERE country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'UK');
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - IN is like filtering customers based on their country, showing only those from the USA, Canada, and the UK.

- **5. Logical Operators:**

  - **AND:**
    - Combines multiple conditions, and all conditions must be true for a row to be included.
  - **OR:**
    - Returns rows if any of the specified conditions are true.
  - **NOT:**
    - Negates a condition, selecting rows that do not match the specified condition.

  ### **Example (Logical Operators):**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'HR' OR (salary > 60000 AND age < 40) AND NOT title = 'Manager';
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Logical operators are like combining filters with AND, OR, and NOT to create complex queries, such as finding HR employees or those with a salary over $60,000 and under 40 years old who are not managers.

### **Metaphor:**

- **SQL Queries are like Asking Questions:**
  - Think of querying a database as asking questions. WHERE is like specifying conditions, LIKE is like searching for patterns, BETWEEN is like defining a range, and IN is like listing options.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- Use **`WHERE`** to filter rows based on conditions.
- Use **`LIKE`** for pattern-based searches.
- Use **`BETWEEN`** for filtering within a range.
- Use **`IN`** for filtering based on a list of values.
- Utilize logical operators (**`AND`**, **`OR`**, **`NOT`**) for more complex conditions.

## You will understand DML and DQL

### **1. DML (Data Manipulation Language):**

DML deals with the manipulation of data stored in the database. It includes operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

- **1.1. INSERT:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Adds new records to a table.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name, age)
  VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 20);
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - Think of INSERT as adding a new student to the school database, providing details like name and age.

- **1.2. UPDATE:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Modifies existing records in a table.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  UPDATE students
  SET age = 21
  WHERE student_id = 1;
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - UPDATE is like changing the age of a specific student in the database, ensuring the information is up-to-date.

- **1.3. DELETE:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Removes records from a table.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM students
  WHERE student_id = 1;
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - DELETE is like removing a student from the school database, erasing their information.

### **2. DQL (Data Query Language):**

DQL is focused on querying, retrieving, and presenting data from a database. It includes the SELECT statement.

- **2.1. SELECT:**

  - **Purpose:**
    - Retrieves data from one or more tables.

  ### **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM students
  WHERE age > 18;
  ```

  - **Metaphor:**
    - SELECT is like asking the database to show you all students who are older than 18, filtering the information based on your criteria.

### **3. Combining DML and DQL:**

- **Example:**

```sql
-- Adding a new student
INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 22);

-- Updating the age of an existing student
UPDATE students
SET age = 23
WHERE student_id = 2;

-- Querying the updated data
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > 20;
```

- **Metaphor:**
  - Think of this as managing a student database. You can add new students, update their information, and query the database to get specific details.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
  - INSERT adds new records.
  - UPDATE modifies existing records.
  - DELETE removes records.
- **DQL (Data Query Language):**
  - SELECT retrieves and presents data.

Understanding DML and DQL allows you to not only manage the data in your database but also retrieve specific information tailored to your needs. It's like being the librarian of a vast library, adding, updating, and finding books based on reader preferences.
