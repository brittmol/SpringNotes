**Objective:**

You will understand how to use built-in SQL functions to manipulate and retrieve data from a database.

**Explanation:**

SQL (Structured Query Language) provides a wide range of built-in functions for performing various operations on data stored in a relational database. These functions help you retrieve, manipulate, and aggregate data efficiently. Here, we'll cover some commonly used SQL functions.

**1. String Functions:**

- **`CONCAT`**: Concatenates two or more strings.

  ```sql
  SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;

  ```

- **`UPPER` and `LOWER`**: Converts a string to uppercase or lowercase.

  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(city) AS capital_city FROM locations;

  ```

**2. Numeric Functions:**

- **`SUM`**: Calculates the sum of numeric values in a column.

  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;

  ```

- **`AVG`**: Computes the average of numeric values in a column.

  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(age) AS average_age FROM customers;

  ```

**3. Date and Time Functions:**

- **`NOW`**: Retrieves the current date and time.

  ```sql
  SELECT NOW() AS current_datetime;

  ```

- **`DATE_FORMAT`**: Formats a date in a specific format.

  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS formatted_date FROM orders;

  ```

**4. Aggregate Functions:**

- **`COUNT`**: Counts the number of rows or non-null values in a column.

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM products;

  ```

- **`MIN` and `MAX`**: Finds the minimum and maximum values in a column.

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(price) AS min_price, MAX(price) AS max_price FROM products;

  ```

**5. Conditional Functions:**

- **`CASE`**: Performs conditional logic in SQL queries.

  ```sql
  SELECT
      CASE
          WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
          ELSE 'Child'
      END AS age_group
  FROM customers;

  ```

- **`COALESCE`**: Returns the first non-null value in a list of expressions.

  ```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(preferred_name, first_name) AS display_name FROM users;

  ```

**6. Mathematical Functions:**

- **`SQRT`**: Calculates the square root of a number.

  ```sql
  SELECT SQRT(area) AS side_length FROM shapes;

  ```

- **`ROUND`**: Rounds a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.

  ```sql
  SELECT ROUND(price, 2) AS rounded_price FROM products;

  ```

These are just a few examples of SQL's built-in functions. SQL offers many more functions, including those for working with text, dates, and specialized operations like aggregation and window functions. Understanding these functions is essential for querying and transforming data effectively in a database system.

**Metaphor:**

Think of SQL functions as specialized tools in a toolbox. Each function has a unique purpose, like a wrench for tightening bolts or a measuring tape for taking measurements. Depending on the task at hand, you choose the appropriate tool (function) to manipulate and retrieve data from your database.

**Objective:**

You will be able to describe the properties of an SQL transaction.

**Explanation:**

In SQL (Structured Query Language), a transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure data consistency, integrity, and reliability in a database system. The properties of a transaction are often summarized by the acronym ACID, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

**1. Atomicity (A):**

- **Property:** Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all its changes are applied to the database, or none of them are.
- **Example:** Consider a funds transfer between two bank accounts. If the transfer involves debiting one account and crediting another, atomicity ensures that both operations succeed or fail together. There won't be a situation where one account is debited without the other being credited.

**2. Consistency (C):**

- **Property:** Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another. In other words, a transaction should not violate the integrity constraints and rules defined for the database.
- **Example:** If a database enforces constraints such as "No negative balances" for bank accounts, a transaction attempting to set an account balance to a negative value would violate consistency and be rejected.

**3. Isolation (I):**

- **Property:** Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of multiple transactions does not interfere with each other. Each transaction should operate as if it is the only transaction in the system, preventing issues like data corruption and inconsistent reads.
- **Example:** Consider two users simultaneously transferring funds from one account to another. Isolation ensures that each user's transaction is isolated from the other until it is completed. Otherwise, one user might see an intermediate state of the data, leading to incorrect results.

**4. Durability (D):**

- **Property:** Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive system failures (e.g., power outage, system crash). The changes made by committed transactions are stored in non-volatile storage.
- **Example:** After a successful funds transfer, the updated account balances should persist even if the database server crashes. Durability ensures that the changes are not lost.

**Transactions in SQL:**

In SQL, transactions are typically managed using the `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` statements. Here's a simplified example:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- Start a new transaction

-- SQL statements for data manipulation and updates

-- If everything is successful
COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction and make changes permanent

-- If an error occurs or conditions are not met
ROLLBACK; -- Roll back the transaction to its initial state

```

By using these statements, you can control the execution and properties of transactions in your SQL database system.

**Metaphor:**

Think of an SQL transaction as a bank transaction. When you transfer money between accounts, you expect the transaction to be atomic (all or nothing), consistent (no invalid actions), isolated (no interference with other transactions), and durable (changes are permanent even in case of a bank's system failure). These properties ensure that your money is managed safely and reliably.

**Objective:**

You will understand Transaction Control Language (TCL) and Data Control Language (DCL) in SQL.

**Explanation:**

In SQL (Structured Query Language), TCL (Transaction Control Language) and DCL (Data Control Language) are specialized subsets of SQL commands that deal with the management of transactions and access control to database objects.

**1. Transaction Control Language (TCL):**

TCL commands are used to manage transactions in a database. A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work, ensuring data integrity and consistency. TCL commands allow you to control the outcome of transactions.

**Common TCL Commands:**

- **`COMMIT`:** The `COMMIT` command is used to permanently save changes made during the current transaction. It marks the successful completion of the transaction.
- **`ROLLBACK`:** The `ROLLBACK` command is used to undo all the changes made during the current transaction. It is typically used when an error occurs or when the transaction should not be applied.
- **`SAVEPOINT`:** The `SAVEPOINT` command creates a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. It allows you to roll back to a specific point within a transaction without rolling back the entire transaction.
- **`ROLLBACK TO`:** The `ROLLBACK TO` command is used to roll back to a specified savepoint within a transaction, undoing all changes made after that savepoint.

**Example:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- Start a transaction

-- SQL statements for data manipulation and updates

-- If everything is successful
COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction

-- If an error occurs or conditions are not met
ROLLBACK; -- Roll back the transaction

```

**2. Data Control Language (DCL):**

DCL commands are used to control access to database objects and establish security within the database. DCL commands grant or revoke privileges (permissions) to users and roles to perform specific actions on database objects.

**Common DCL Commands:**

- **`GRANT`:** The `GRANT` command is used to give specific privileges to users or roles. These privileges can include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or others.
- **`REVOKE`:** The `REVOKE` command is used to remove previously granted privileges from users or roles.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Grant SELECT privilege on a table to a user
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO johndoe;

-- Revoke INSERT privilege on a table from a user
REVOKE INSERT ON products FROM janedoe;

```

**Metaphor:**

Think of TCL as a control panel for managing a transaction at a bank. You can commit the transaction to make it permanent (like confirming a financial transaction) or roll it back to undo it (like canceling a financial transaction).

DCL is like a security officer at a secure facility. They have the authority to grant or revoke access privileges to different areas of the facility (database). For example, they can grant or revoke access to specific rooms (tables) for certain individuals (users or roles).

**Objective:**

You will be able to describe SQL Functions, Triggers, Sequences, and Stored Procedures in the context of a relational database management system (RDBMS).

**Explanation:**

In SQL (Structured Query Language), Functions, Triggers, Sequences, and Stored Procedures are database objects and constructs that provide various capabilities for data manipulation, automation, and control within a relational database.

**1. SQL Functions:**

SQL Functions are pre-defined or user-defined operations that can take input values, perform calculations or actions, and return a single value or a result set. Functions are used to simplify complex queries, perform calculations, and format data.

- **Pre-defined Functions:** These are built-in functions provided by the database management system (DBMS). Examples include `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, and `CONCAT`.
- **User-defined Functions:** You can create your own custom functions using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement. User-defined functions can encapsulate business logic and be reused in SQL queries.

**2. SQL Triggers:**

SQL Triggers are database objects that automatically execute a set of SQL statements in response to specific events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table. Triggers are used to enforce data integrity, audit changes, or automate tasks.

- **Types of Triggers:** There are two main types of triggers:
  - **Before Triggers (BEFORE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):** These triggers are executed before the triggering event, allowing you to validate or modify data before it is changed.
  - **After Triggers (AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):** These triggers are executed after the triggering event, typically used for auditing or logging changes.

**3. Sequences:**

Sequences are database objects that generate a series of unique values, typically used for generating primary key values in tables. Sequences are especially useful when you need to ensure unique and incremental values across multiple transactions and sessions.

- **Creating a Sequence:** Sequences are created using the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement.
- **Using a Sequence:** You can use the `NEXTVAL` and `CURRVAL` functions to obtain the next value and the current value of a sequence, respectively.

**4. Stored Procedures:**

Stored Procedures are precompiled and reusable SQL statements or blocks of code that are stored in the database. They can accept input parameters, perform operations, and return results. Stored procedures are used for encapsulating business logic and providing a standardized way to interact with the database.

- **Creating a Stored Procedure:** Stored procedures are created using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` or `CREATE FUNCTION` statement, depending on the DBMS.
- **Executing a Stored Procedure:** You can execute a stored procedure using the `EXECUTE` statement or by calling it from an application.

These database objects and constructs enhance the capabilities of an RDBMS, enabling you to perform complex operations, automate tasks, maintain data integrity, and organize your database logic effectively.

**Metaphor:**

Think of SQL Functions as calculators or tools that perform specific tasks. Triggers are like automatic sensors that respond to certain events, like turning on a light when you enter a room. Sequences are like ticket numbers issued in an orderly fashion. Stored Procedures are like predefined recipes that can be followed to cook a specific dish, saving time and ensuring consistency in preparation.
